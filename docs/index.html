      <li>[HUNTER X HUNTER] Nen - A Talent, the power of a chosen few.</li>
      <p><strong>Fri Apr 22 10:52:44 AM -03 2022</strong> In the anime Hunter X Hunter a creature that discover the existence of Nen for the first time describe it with this quote: <i>So... this is a talent. The power of a chosen few.</i> Right after that he find out that another much more powerful being is born, one that eclipse his new found strength by his presence alone. But that does not invalidate his first assessment, he just discover that his idea of <i>few</i> was too broad. This is a very interesting concept that the Japanese seem to be fond of, the idea of <i>latent talent</i>. A idea that some people are born with a difference in potential relative to the majority. The concept of geniuses. On the same anime a man training a boy on the use of Nen try to lift up his spirit by saying to him that he is a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent but the protagonists witch talent eclipsed his were two-in-ten-million. Frequently in anime based games an interesting effect is used to both make the <i>important characters</i> stand out and the <i>unnamed NPCs</i> blend in with the background, this effect show these NPCs as just dark silhouettes while the important people is fully rendered. This effect does optimise computational resources by simplifying the render of non important characters but also add to that feeling that most people are just not important, a feeling that seem frequent portrayed in Japanese games/anime. In contrast to this idea there is the famous <i>meme</i> of the crowded train... [in a crowded train all people are thinking while what seems to be a every day commute "I'm not like these people around me, I have may thoughts ideas and plans..." but the thought balloon is shared by all], so goes the saying "everyone think they are the protagonist of the story". In reality everyone is the protagonist of their own story, and the others just play a part on it, this is a world wide phenomenon that seem more prominent in a crowded and hostile to individualism like Japan.
